The Software UNified Collaboration for Advancing Solar Tomography (SUNCAST) project aims to create a comprehensive, open-source software framework for advancing our understanding of the 3D structure of the solar corona. The framework will combine ground-based and space-based remote-sensing multi-wavelength observations with sophisticated forward-fitting algorithms and 3D modeling. The project will establish a centralized platform to access and share high-quality data, algorithms, and tools for data analysis and data-constrained modeling.  The SUNCAST repository will be developed using modern software engineering practices that will ensure its long-term sustainability and accessibility. SUNCAST will leverage available world-widely used software resources developed over the last decade by the team members and collaborators with support from the AST, AGS, and EarthCube NSF Programs. The project will upgrade  this state-of-the-art software, to prepare it for scaling to a cloud-based, high performance, parallel computing architecture. By doing so, we will pave the way for its wider use and faster results, which will increase research efficiency.
