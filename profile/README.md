# 🌞 SUNCAST — Software UNified Collaboration for Advancing Solar Tomography

Welcome to **SUNCAST**, an open-science initiative dedicated to developing a modern, sustainable, and community-driven software ecosystem for advancing 3D studies of the solar corona. SUNCAST supports research that combines ground-based and space-based remote-sensing observations with physics-based forward modeling, spectral fitting, and data-constrained tomography.

The SUNCAST GitHub organization hosts interoperable, cloud-ready scientific tools (including **pyGSFIT**, **pyAMPP**, and **pyGSK**) along with reproducible workflows, examples, documentation, and community training resources.

We are committed to open-source development guided by **FAIR**, **CARE**, and **TRUST** principles, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, equity, and sustainability.

A formal Governance Board (in formation) will oversee the long-term stewardship of SUNCAST software and guide community contributions.

For details on how to contribute, see **[GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)**.
