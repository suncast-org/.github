Welcome to **SUNCAST**, an open-science initiative dedicated to developing a modern, sustainable, and community-driven software ecosystem for advancing 3D studies of the solar corona. SUNCAST supports research that combines ground-based and space-based remote-sensing observations with physics-based forward modeling, spectral fitting, and data-constrained tomography.

The SUNCAST GitHub organization hosts interoperable, cloud-ready scientific tools — including **pyGSFIT**, **pyAMPP**, and **pyGSK** — along with reproducible workflows, documentation, training materials, and community-driven development resources.

We are committed to open-source development guided by the **FAIR**, **CARE**, and **TRUST** principles, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, ethical stewardship, and long-term sustainability.

A formal Governance Board (in formation) will guide SUNCAST’s long-term development, community participation, and maintenance standards.
