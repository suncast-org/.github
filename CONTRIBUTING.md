## 🧰 Contribution Workflow (For All Repositories)

1. **Fork the repository** to your personal GitHub account.  
2. **Create a feature branch** for your work:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
3. **Make your changes** (code, docs, tests, examples).  
4. **Commit with clear messages**:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new SK threshold example"
   ```
5. **Push your branch** to your fork:  
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request** to the repository under `suncast-org`.  
7. Participate in the review process.

## 🌱 Starting New Projects

If you want to propose a new tool or workflow:

### **Option A: Independent development (recommended for new ideas)**
1. Create the repository under your personal GitHub space.
2. Develop and test your idea freely.
3. When the project is ready for broader use, request a **repository transfer** into the SUNCAST organization.

### **Option B: Start directly under SUNCAST (only for coordinated projects)**
If the project is part of a SUNCAST deliverable or collaborative effort, ask a maintainer to create a repository under `suncast-org` and follow the fork → PR model.
